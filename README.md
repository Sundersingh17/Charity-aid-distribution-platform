 Charity Aid Distribution Platform

## Project Description

The Charity Aid Distribution Platform is a blockchain-based solution built on the Stellar network that enables NGOs and charitable organizations to issue, distribute, and track aid tokens transparently. This smart contract system ensures accountability, reduces fraud, and provides real-time visibility into aid distribution workflows. By leveraging Stellar's fast, low-cost transaction capabilities, the platform makes humanitarian aid delivery more efficient and traceable from donor to beneficiary.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize humanitarian aid distribution by creating a transparent, efficient, and accountable system that builds trust between donors, NGOs, and beneficiaries. We aim to eliminate inefficiencies and corruption in aid distribution through blockchain technology, ensuring that every token of aid reaches its intended recipient. By providing immutable records and real-time tracking, we empower stakeholders to verify impact and make data-driven decisions in crisis response and development programs.

Key Features

 1. **Token Issuance & Management**
- NGOs can create custom aid tokens representing different types of assistance (food, medicine, shelter vouchers)
